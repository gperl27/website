*Audience*

Frontend developers who work at an agile workplace

*Goal*

Give people a pragmatic, non-codified method on how to approach implementing mockups

## Beginning

> Make this screen

Sound familiar? Yes, you've been assigned a task backed by measly ol' mock-up; you might have an Invision or a fancy [your-trendy-ux-mockups-tool-here] schematic as well.

Ok, time to start coding! No, not just yet.

But...I told my manger I'd have this done by the end of the day!

I'm not saying you can't do it, but, let's think about when you are given your next task and it happens to share the same header, buttons, maybe even some data. Maybe you already have thought of these things and future-proofed your work. If so, that's excellent! You may not even need to continue reading.


**Frontend is *hard***

*Just* a few things we have to think about

- All the different devices that are out there
- How browsers may render things differently
    - They might even hijack functionality (I'm looking at you, Chrome autofill)
- Asynchronous data
- Realtime data
- Persistent data
- Displaying such data (in a human readable way)
- Color
- Typography
- Interaction
- Forms (yup)
- Change
- More change
- Yup, someone changed their mind again
- Oh wait, just another change

Now, this article aims not to cover all of these topics, but rather it is about staying cognizant of these different factors and parameters and coming up with a strategy of preparation in order to **adapt your interfaces** with confidence in the future.
